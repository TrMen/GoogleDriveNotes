# GoogleDriveNotes

Application for taking down notes in a command line. Will sync files with Google Drive. Requires a credentials.json (which is not provided for obvious reasons) in the folder to function.
It is possible to set passwords for note pages, and all files will be encrypted on disc as well as remotely.
